### Team formation

No need to register your team or idea upfront.
Teams get registered when you submit to Devpost (on sunday, see below).

Hacker, looking for a team? Team, looking for an additional hacker?
On Friday, 11.30pm find each other in Courtyard 1 (Food courtyard). Don’t be shy. The community is open and everyone here shares a passion for building open source technologies.
Also, go to the [hacker’s riot chat](https://matrix.to/#/!WTJBLneNDtLzLNlkmU:matrix.org) (#ethberlinhackers:matrix.org) or the [Github repo (Team building)](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding)


## Prizes
### [Prizes on Devpost](https://ethberlin.devpost.com/)
- **Open Track Prize:** This is the main prize of ETHBerlin. There will be 10 winners. The grand bounty is of approximately 75.000 € and it’s distributed equally. You can calculate it ;)
- **People’s Choice Awards:** Previous Hackathons have showed that people’s favourite teams were not always among the actual winners. At ETHBerlin, we would like to give those projects a chance by rewarding the people’s favorite team with a community prize of 1000€. The winner will be determined from the top 5 teams through an [Olympia](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosis-olympia-5fb7e16dd259?gi=de34dba69451) prediction market tournament. For details go [here](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Bounties/issues/29). The mentors will vote initially (not on Olympia) to determine the top 5 projects. The top 5 will then be determined through the Olympia prediction market by all of the community as outlined above.

### [Prizes on Github](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Bounties/issues)
- **Sponsor Prizes:** Some of ETHBerlin’s sponsors have their own price awards. They can each pay out a maximum of 5000 €. These prizes will be funded and distributed via Gitcoin. Note that ETHBerlin has no influence on neither the challenge nor the judging, this is entirely up to the sponsors. You can find all the prize awards [here](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Bounties/issues).
- **Community Improvement Awards:** These are small prizes endowed with 1000 € each by ETHBerlin. Check them out [here](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Bounties/issues).

**IMPORTANT:** Note that you can submit your work to multiple prize awards, they are not exclusive! So for example you can submit your work to the open track bounty and a sponsor specific prize, just make sure to submit it everywhere where you want to participate.

### Submission Guidelines

- Hacking starts during the event. Teams can form and ideas can evolve before the hackathon. However, the code base, hacks, and prototypes that you create for any apps competing for prizes or bounties need to evolve **only** during the hackathon. Apps, hacks, and projects that were built before the event do **not** qualify and will be excluded from judging and any prizes.
- Teams should have a **maximum of 5 team members** consisting of registered hackers only.
- The project should have an open source license and what has been produced during the hackathon should be publicly available and accessible by judges and everyone else.
- A short **presentation** file must describe your project. It has to be accessible without special tools. Ideally a PDF, Google slides, or even a hosted recording if you like. The judges need to all be able to access those presentations.
- You need to provide a link, which acts as an entry point to your project. Ideally, this link would be a public repository containing the code, team members, presentations and documentation on how one can use your code.
- Smart contracts must be deployed to a public testnet or the Ethereum mainnet.
- Submission closes at 11:30 am on Sunday the 9. of September 2018.

### Submission of sponsored prizes

Each sponsored prize has a github issue in the [prizes repository]([https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Bounties](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Bounties/settings/collaboration)). After you've decided which ones you want to apply for, you need to go to the Gitcoin bounty associated with that prize, and click on "Start Work". At the end, the sponsor would decide for a team, and pay out the bounty through Gitcoin.

These prizes are different from the Open Track prize and People's choice award.

### Judging

- Submission closes at 11:30 am on Sunday the 9. of September 2018
- Judging for the Open Track Prize will happen based on whatever was provided via Devpost
- After your submission the judging team will check for the submission guidlines and will leave a comment on your github repository. **Watch for comments starting at around 12pm**
- Judging will happen on the 3rd floor
- Each project will be judged by two different judging groups to reduce subjective opinion
- You will present your project to each judging group once. 5mins presentation/demo + 2 mins for Q&A/Feedback

- Sponsored prizes are judged by the respective sponsor, and will have different judging criteria. 
-- Again: The ETHBerlin Judging team does not judge on sponsor prizes!

### Usage
We've tried to split the knowledge base into different parts, so that you may find
information relevant to your role, and the stage of the event, easily. Please start
with going through the overview and event which contain general information.

### Overview

##### What is ETHBerlin
We assume, if you're reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin is, but just to recap:

ETHBerlin is a combination of a hackathon, workshops and talks, happening from 7th till 9th of September 2018 in Berlin, Germany.
It's proudly a part of the ETHGlobal community. For more, please refer to the [website](https://ethberlin.com).

##### Phases
[Preparation & Planning](#preparation-and-planning) | [The Event](#the-event)

##### Roles
When you've read the general information for all of the phases above, you may find information
specific to your role here:

[Hackers*](hackers.md) | [Volunteers](volunteers.md) | [Speakers]() | [Mentors](mentors.md) | [Judges](judges.md) | [Sponsors](sponsors.md) | [Community Members](community-members.md) | [Organization Team]()
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

*Hacker*: Someone who takes part in the hackathon by joining a team and working on a project, and the term
doesn't exclusively refer to people with software development backgrounds.

##### Commitment to Using Dapps
Or "If you liked it then you shoulda put a dApp on it"!

ETHBerlin will try to use tools created within the ecosystem as much as possible for its various needs.
This paves the way for adoption of web3, which we're all trying to buidl, and acts as a good
testing ground for the dapps, consequently helping the respective teams to learn from this experience
and make the softwares even better.
For more on this, check out the [article](https://medium.com/ethberlin/if-you-liked-it-then-you-shoulda-put-a-dapp-on-it-626b032d32a5).

##### Communication Channel
One of the dapps, mentioned above, that we love and use a lot, is [Status](status.im/). Make sure you install it
and come say hi in the [#ethberlin](https://get.status.im/chat/public/ethberlin) channel. Feel free to ask for
couches there, or discuss sharing flat with other participants. We also have channels for getting to know eachother
and building teams!

### Preparation and Planning
*For everyone*

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps:

##### Getting to Berlin
[Here](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.
Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited
and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. However, there is a very limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage
everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [us](joinus@ethberlin.com).

##### Accommodation
There are a variety of options available in Berlin for the purpose of accomodation. From hostels to
airbnb flats and hotels. We recommend the regions Treptow, Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain due to their 
close proximity to the venue.
As part of our commitment to using dapps extensively throughout the hackathon, we're in close contact
with the team behind [Winding Tree](https://windingtree.com/), and most probably they will launch to
mainnet within the next few days, in which case, you can reserve a place with ETH or LIF, their native token.

##### Venues
Day 1 (7. September) consists of a two-track conference in *two* venues:

- **Factory Mitte** (Rheinsberger Straße 76/77)
- **Factory Görlitzer Park** (Lohmühlenstraße 65)

After the conferences are done, the hackathon people will get together at **Factory Görlitzer** – this will be the *only venue* after the conferences – at 22:00 when the opening ceremony (accompanied by dinner & drinks) and team formation will take place. The Hackathon kicks off at 00:00 on September 8th.

##### Tickets
If you are a hacker, a mentor, a registered sponsor, a volunteer, a judge or a speaker you don’t need a ticket, just your e-mail confirmation and ID.

Community tickets for Day 1 conferences will be launched via Peepeth on a Blockparty Smart Contract on September 1st. All tickets are free. Community tickets do *not* enable access to the Hackathon or Day 2 & 3 Workshops. Thank you in advance for respecting the hackers and their #BUIDL.
